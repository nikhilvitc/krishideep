# Krisi Deep Logo Integration - Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## âœ… What's Been Done:

1. **Created assets structure**: `assets/images/` directory created
2. **Updated pubspec.yaml**: Added images folder to assets
3. **Updated splash screen**: Now uses the Krisi Deep logo with fallback
4. **Updated login screen**: Now uses the Krisi Deep logo with fallback
5. **Smart fallback system**: If logo image is missing, falls back to agriculture icon

## ðŸ“‹ Next Step for You:

**Save your logo image as:** `assets/images/krisi_deep_logo.png`

Simply save the beautiful Krisi Deep logo you showed me as a PNG file with the name `krisi_deep_logo.png` in the `assets/images/` folder.

## ðŸ”„ After Adding the Logo:

1. The app will automatically use your logo in:
   - Splash screen (circular container)
   - Login screen (top of form)
   
2. Hot reload the app (`r` in terminal) and you'll see your logo appear!

## ðŸŽ¨ Logo Features:

- **Circular display** on splash screen with shadow
- **80x80 size** on login screen  
- **Smart loading** with fallback to agriculture icon
- **Proper fit** - logo will scale nicely within containers

The app is ready and will seamlessly switch to your logo once you save the file!

- âœ… Logo integration complete with fallback system
